# Advent of TypeScript 2024 - Day 2

[🎅Santa's reindeer,⚡Blitzen, has a secret meeting with 🎩Bernard, the head of the elves after ☄️Comet and 💨Dasher presented 🎅Santa with their a pay increase demand./]
[⚡Blitzen] Did Santa go for it? Did he accept our Demand for a pay increase?
[🎩Bernard] Those moron's ☄️Comet and 💨Dasher just wrote down number.  I told them to write down a number.
[⚡Blitzen] What in the actual F...
[🎩Bernard] I know I know.  You have to really spell it out for them.
[⚡Blitzen] Alright.  I'll take care of it.  I'll budget 100k for each of us Reindeer.  That’s enough to cover therapy for pulling Santa’s bloated cheeks across three continents, plus a little left over for a sleigh-side mojito bar.
[🎩Bernard] I swear if I have to hold their hand anymore we're gonna put Reindeer sausage on the menu like the humans in Alaska seem to enjoy so much.
[⚡Blitzen, agast] You realize I'm a reindeer?  You gotta lay off the powered sugar bro.
[🎩Bernard] Over my dead body.  It's the only thing that makes me feel good in this nightmare of a job.

Yesterday ☄️Comet and 💨Dasher just gave number as their demand to 🎅Santa.  That's not nearly specific enough.  We're gonna need something much more specific.

Look at the tests.  See what we can change to make them all pass.

Hint
In TypeScript, we can specify types with primitives like `number` and `boolean` and `string` but we can also specify types with _type literals_ like `1`, `true`, and `"abcd"`.  In this case, you can see that the tests are showing you that you need to provide a _number literal_ to make the tests pass.

## Initial Code
```typescript
type Demand = number;
```

## Tests
```typescript
import type { Expect, Equal } from 'type-testing';
type t0_actual = Demand;        // => type t0_actual = number
type t0_expected = 900_000; // => type t0_expected = 900000
type t0 = Expect<Equal<t0_actual, t0_expected>>;
/*
* Sometimes, throughout Advent of TypeScript, you'll see a test that asserts there _is_ a type error, often to ensure that you're providing a correct implementation.
* In this example, passing `number` isn't good enough, so we're highlighting that to you by showing that would cause a type error if `number` is the value of `Demand`.
*/
// @ts-expect-error
type e0 = Expect<Equal<Demand, number>>;
