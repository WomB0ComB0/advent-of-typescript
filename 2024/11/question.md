# Advent of TypeScript 2024 - Day 11

[Last night, while the reindeer plotted on how to leverage 💋Crystal Claus with their knowledge of her affair with 🪩Jamie Glitterglum, 💋Crystal and 🪩Jamie met up in a panic.  Today, 🎅Santa is beginning to suspect something]
[🎅Santa] Dear.. Where were you last night?
[💋Crystal, turning bright red in embarrassment] Oh.  Uh, I was out doing karaoke with some friends.  Kendrick Lamar and Opeth both released albums on the same day last month, so we've been learning all the songs to both. [coughing nervously] Oh [cough] and also we were trying out a new drink one of the elves came up with.  It's a bit like a mojito but instead of mint it's.. well it's a whole thing.  Then we also
[🎅Santa] You seem nervous.
[💋Crystal, sweating] Oh, no, not at all!  Not at all!  It's just so hard to remember, you can understand!
[Later that night 💋Crystal and 🪩Jamie met again.]
[💋Crystal] We're in BIG trouble.  What are we gonna do!!?  We need a new excuse, and we need to add something to it.  But... what??
[🪩Jamie] Talk to him again, but this time be ready to add to your excuse!  Just bury him in details.  🎅Santa tunes out if you say anything longer than two sentences about non-cookie-related topics.  Think of a few different excuses, just in case.

We already have a Excuse that 💋Crystal provided 🎅Santa, but now we need to extend it in some way.  We need it to be general-purpose, so 💋Crystal can try a few different ideas out.
Hint
How do you create a "newable" object in JavaScript (i.e. one that you use the `new` keyword with)?  How do you provide TypeScript types to such a thing?
