# Advent of TypeScript 2024 - Day 5

[❤️Cupid and 🌟Vixen are presenting 🎅Santa with their work on the route for this year's Christmas present delivery.]
[🎅Santa] What is it? Are you guys working blindfolded or what!??
[❤️Cupid] Hardly. We've been working on this for weeks and weeks.
[🎅Santa] What am I even shelling out these beautiful carrots for? It's like it's suddenly amateur hour at the North Pole!
[🌟Vixen] Actually, funny you should raise that point because you pay us for a quality of work far below what we've just provided.  You should be thrilled.
[🎅Santa] I don't want any more of that attitude from you, 🌟Vixen.  I think you should think of the position that puts your colleagues in when you talk like that.  Should I pay them less just so I can pay you more?  Huh?
[🌟Vixen] I'm getting tired of going around-and-around with you on this.  Just tell us what you want.
[🎅Santa] Well for one thing, the route should be should be able to handle any arbitrary input!  And while you’re at it, make the route solar-powered. The PR team says it’s time we went carbon neutral.

🎅Santa is hard to please.  That much is for sure.  To appease him, we want a function that will accept any input and return a value that has exactly the same type.
Hint
You need to find some way to pass this function a _parameter_ which is, itself, a type.  There's a generic and general purpose syntax for doing this.  Are you familiar with it?
