# Advent of TypeScript 2023 - Day 16

Find Santa (part 2)

Since the episode with him getting lost on Tuesday (Day 12), the elves have started to get concerned about Santa getting lost again, but deeper in the forest. Since Santa's college buddy got WiFi installed in the whole property, Santa just wanders around scrolling TikTok without looking where he's going. Santa claimed that the reason the whole campus needed WiFi (even the forest) was to "future-proof the business" and "attract top talent" but it's beginning to seem like it was so he could personally get better phone service (cell reception in the north pole isn't great and without 116th H.R.7302, neither is the rural internet speed).

Sure enough. It happened again. Santa got lost, again, but this time much deeper in the forest.

This time we have to search columns as well as rows to find him.

The FindSanta takes only one argument, the forest (an array of arrays), and returns the [Row, Column] indices where Santa is located. Then an elf search team can be deployed to retrieve him.

type FindSanta = unknown;

```

## Tests

import { Expect, Equal } from 'type-testing';

type Forest0 = [
['🎅🏼', '🎄', '🎄', '🎄'],
['🎄', '🎄', '🎄', '🎄'],
['🎄', '🎄', '🎄', '🎄'],
['🎄', '🎄', '🎄', '🎄'],
];
type test_0_actual = FindSanta<Forest0>;
//   ^? type test_0_actual = any
type test_0_expected = [0, 0];
type test_0 = Expect<Equal<test_0_expected, test_0_actual>>;

type Forest1 = [
